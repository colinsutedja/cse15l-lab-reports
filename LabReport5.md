PART 2
Something that I learned the second half of this quarter was doing everything from terminal. I thought it was cool that we could do so much in terminal which is something I didn't know from before. It was cool that we could edit files in vim and then push that change back to main like on github and then we would be able to see those changes as well. Another thing was how we used jdb and how we could stop at a certain line to see what was happening at that point. It was cool seeing how we could use this to debug and figure our certain things about how our code runs.
